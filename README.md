# Minimum Viable Product: BART Reminder System
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com).

## Instructions

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run webpack`
3. Ensure that databasePassword.js and API_keys.js files have been created in database and server folders respectively with the appropriate keys. This project is the public BART API key and your own private Twilio API key.
4. `npm start`
5. `npm test` to run Jest/Enzyme
